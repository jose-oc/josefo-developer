I&#8217;m going to write here my notes about how to write clean code. These are the ideas I extract from my reading of the book _&#8220;Clean code&#8221; by Robert C. Martin_ and from my own experience.

The main purpose of these notes is to remember it to myself but if someone wants to discuss it feel free to do it.

You can find all these post searching the tag_Â clean code_.
