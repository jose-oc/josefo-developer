      I remember when I was studying at University I wasÂ taught about the difference between passing parameters by value or by reference. But in Java there isn&#8217;t any way to explicit this, then how is Java using parameters?

    <div style="text-align: justify">
      The answer is <strong>by value</strong>, always. But this answer could be a little tricky, let&#8217;s see it in detail.
    </div>

  <h2>
    Primitive types
  </h2> Primitive types are passed by value, you 
  
  <strong>can not change its value</strong> within a method. I&#8217;ll give you an example: 
  
  <pre class="lang:java decode:true" title="primitive types"> class Car {
        public void changeVariable(int a) {
            a = 321;
        }
    }

    private void demoPrimitiveValues() {
        int v = 1;
        Car car = new Car();
        car.changeVariable(v);
        System.out.println(v); // 1
    }</pre>
  
  <h2>
    Objects
  </h2> When we pass an object as the argument of a method what it is really happen is that Java is doing a 
  
  <strong>copy of the pointer at the object</strong>, not the same pointer that we are using out of this method so it is passed by value. Being a pointer to the object we&#8217;ll be able to modify the content of the object and we&#8217;ll get the object modified after the execution of the method but we won&#8217;t be able to create a new object and assign it from within the method because the pointer we have inside is not the same. I&#8217;ll give you an example of this: 
  
  <pre class="lang:java decode:true" title="Changing properties of an object param">  class Person {
        String name;
    }

    class Writer {
        public void changeName(Person person) {
            person.name = "Lola";
        }
    }

    private void demoObjectValues_changingItsProperties() {
        Person person = new Person();
        person.name = "Mary";
        (new Writer()).changeName( person );
        System.out.println(person.name); //Lola
    }</pre> Running this example you&#8217;ll notice that the field has been changed, the name we can see in the console is &#8220;Lola&#8221;.
</div>

<div>
  <div style="text-align: justify">
    Let&#8217;s see another one:
  </div>
  
  <div style="text-align: justify">
    <pre class="lang:java decode:true " title="Changing the pointer to an object">  class Writer {      
        /**
         * Changing the pointer of the param
         * @param person
         */
        public void changePerson(Person person) {
            Person newPerson = new Person();
            newPerson.name = "Blas de Lezo";
            person = newPerson;
        }
    }

    private void demoObjectValues_changingPointer() {
        Person person = new Person();
        person.name = "Mary";
        (new Writer()).changePerson( person );
        System.out.println(person.name); //Mary
    }</pre>
  </div>
  
  <div style="text-align: justify">
    In this example we&#8217;ve created a new object Person called Mary and we give this object to the method changePerson where the argument (in this case the Person Mary) is replaced by a new Person called &#8220;Blas de Lezo&#8221; but we noticed that this replacement haven&#8217;t been happen out of the method since the name printed is &#8220;Mary&#8221;. This is because the pointer passed was a copy.
