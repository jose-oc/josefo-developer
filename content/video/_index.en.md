## Encode or Transcode

Both terms are used interchangeably frequently but the term **encode** is about converting an analog content into a digital one, for instance convert a video from VHS or Super 8 into MP4 or some audio from a vinyl disc into a flac file. In comparison, **transcode** refers to transform some content between two digital formats.
