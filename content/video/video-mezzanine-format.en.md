A Mezzanine file is a lightly compressed master file that will stand up to making additional compressed versions. The use of mezzanine files is popular as they simplify the process for most users. In this case, a high-quality file is created using minimal compression. A popular choice is to use the H.264 codec, but with a data rate that is much higher than a DSLR camera. The file is smaller and easier to backup or transport, as ome compression is applied, meaning that the file can be more easily shared or transferred using the Internet. However, the data rate is high enough so that the file can be easily re-compressed for smaller sizes.
