These two terms are frequently mixed up.

After reading a few articles I think I know what each of them means. 
To be clear, **concurrency** is what my mother used to do while **parallelism** is what my mother achieved assigning everyone in my family a task to get done. 
This is, my mother managed different tasks at the same time, she was able to talk with my sister while was helping me with my homework while was making the dinner and doing a crossword. She seemed to be doing all of that at the same time but if there were a super-smart housefly at home and we were able to ask how many things were she doing at the same, the fly would have answered that only one, because flies can see much faster than humans and it would realised that my mum did one thing - not completely - and changed to another task very quickly. That was **concurrency**. 
But, hey, my mum was also able to assigne tasks to each of us: my father, my brothers and sisters and all of us would do these tasks at the same time. That is **parallelims** because those task were being done at the precisely same instant of time.

If we move to the computer, each person would be a core so a computer with only one core wouldn't be able to run processes in parallel but it's able to run concurrently.
