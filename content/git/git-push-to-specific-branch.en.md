To push your commits to remote server.

First of all you should be working on the branch, with this commando you switch to it:

<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">git checkout &lt;branch-name&gt;</pre>

&nbsp; Then you push your commits:

<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">git push origin &lt;branch-name&gt;</pre>

&nbsp;
